# member variables to be considered for translation
# example:
#     - description : would consider all `description` assignments
#                     in instance/prototype definition
#     - name        : would consider all name assigments, so even `name[_]` asignments
#                     for C_NPC and C_ITEM instances and prototypes

  # symbols that should NOT be considered for translation
  # works for instances too, if you specify an instance `My_Weapon` all its member would not be included
  # works also for arrays, no need to specify `[]`, the name of the symbol is enough
